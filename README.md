# Unit-converter
This project aims at creating a convenient (energy) unit converter application that physical scientists will find easy to use

## Introduction
When scientists are dealing with atoms and molecules, they don't use "Macro" units like, *lb* or *oz*, they use "Micro" units such as the celebrated **eV**(electron volt). Why? Because that way they don't have to worry about all the "nasty" pre-factor constants, and don't have to convert back and forth from *kg*, *s* all the time, which makes life much simpler. It might also just be more "intuitive" to scientists and when young researchers enter into the fields they just adopt the convention. 

Nonetheless, even when all the units are conveniently boiled down to be measured with the concept of **energy** in mind, the difference between spectral experimentalists (who often use *cm* inverse) and electronic structure physicists (who mostly use *eV* apparently) in terms of preference of units are not so straightforward. Therefore it will be helpful to young researchers (like myself) to give a brief summary of the relations of all these units, and useful if some tiny "converter" utility is developed to make everybody's life happy and productive.
